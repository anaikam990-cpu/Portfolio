    <h2>Building Simple Websites</h2>
    <p>
        In my free time, I like practicing web development by creating 
        simple and clean websites. I enjoy working with HTML and CSS 
        because it allows me to design layouts and understand how websites 
        actually work behind the scenes.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a BCA student with a strong interest in web development and basic programming.
        I have knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java, and MySQL, and I enjoy building simple and 
        responsive websites. I am also exploring data tools like Excel and Power BI to 
        improve my analytical skills.
    </p>

    <p>
        Apart from technical skills, I am a quick learner, good at communication, 
        and comfortable working in a team environment. I believe in consistent practice 
        and self-improvement. My goal is to strengthen my fundamentals and gain practical 
        experience in the IT field.
